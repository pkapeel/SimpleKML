# SimpleKML

The intent of this program is to take a .KML file with a complex structure and break it down into its parts only needed to display basic lines and shapes and colors. This is a brute force method of insuring that the resultant .KML file is compatible with GPS tracking software that would otherwise have issues displaying the original .KML file.
